POLR3A	DNA-directed RNA polymerase III subunit RPC1 (RNA polymerase III subunit C1) (EC 2.7.7.6) (DNA-directed RNA polymerase III largest subunit) (DNA-directed RNA polymerase III subunit A) (RNA polymerase III 155 kDa subunit) (RPC155) (RNA polymerase III subunit C160)	chromatin binding [GO:0003682]; DNA binding [GO:0003677]; DNA-directed 5'-3' RNA polymerase activity [GO:0003899]; DNA/RNA hybrid binding [GO:0071667]; magnesium ion binding [GO:0000287]; zinc ion binding [GO:0008270]	FUNCTION: Catalytic core component of RNA polymerase III (Pol III), a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase which synthesizes small non-coding RNAs using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates. Synthesizes 5S rRNA, snRNAs, tRNAs and miRNAs from at least 500 distinct genomic loci (PubMed:19609254, PubMed:19631370, PubMed:20413673, PubMed:33335104, PubMed:33558764, PubMed:33558766, PubMed:34675218, PubMed:35637192, PubMed:9331371). Pol III-mediated transcription cycle proceeds through transcription initiation, transcription elongation and transcription termination stages. During transcription initiation, Pol III is recruited to DNA promoters type I, II or III with the help of general transcription factors and other specific initiation factors. Once the polymerase has escaped from the promoter it enters the elongation phase during which RNA is actively polymerized, based on complementarity with the template DNA strand. Transcription termination involves the release of the RNA transcript and polymerase from the DNA (PubMed:20413673, PubMed:33335104, PubMed:33558764, PubMed:33558766, PubMed:33674783, PubMed:34675218). Forms Pol III active center together with the second largest subunit POLR3B/RPC2. Appends one nucleotide at a time to the 3' end of the nascent RNA, with POLR3A/RPC1 contributing a Mg(2+)-coordinating DxDGD motif, and POLR3B/RPC2 participating in the coordination of a second Mg(2+) ion and providing lysine residues believed to facilitate Watson-Crick base pairing between the incoming nucleotide and template base. Typically, Mg(2+) ions direct a 5' nucleoside triphosphate to form a phosphodiester bond with the 3' hydroxyl of the preceding nucleotide of the nascent RNA, with the elimination of pyrophosphate (PubMed:19609254, PubMed:20413673, PubMed:33335104, PubMed:33558764, PubMed:33674783, PubMed:34675218, PubMed:9331371). Pol III plays a key role in sensing and limiting infection by intracellular bacteria and DNA viruses. Acts as a nuclear and cytosolic DNA sensor involved in innate immune response. Can sense non-self dsDNA that serves as template for transcription into dsRNA. The non-self RNA polymerase III transcripts, such as Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNAs (EBERs) induce type I interferon and NF-kappa-B through the RIG-I pathway. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19609254, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19631370, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20413673, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33335104, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33558764, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33558766, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33674783, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34675218, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35637192, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9331371}.

Functions as a pH- and Na(+)-independent, bidirectional transporter (By similarity). Cation cellular uptake or release is driven by the electrochemical potential (i.e. membrane potential and concentration gradient) and substrate selectivity (By similarity). Hydrophobicity is a major requirement for recognition in polyvalent substrates and inhibitors (By similarity). Primarily expressed at the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes and proximal tubules and involved in the uptake and disposition of cationic compounds by hepatic and renal clearance from the blood flow (By similarity). Most likely functions as an uptake carrier in enterocytes contributing to the intestinal elimination of organic cations from the systemic circulation (PubMed:16263091). Transports endogenous monoamines such as N-1-methylnicotinamide (NMN), guanidine, histamine, neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin and adrenaline (PubMed:12439218, PubMed:24961373, PubMed:35469921, PubMed:9260930). Also transports natural polyamines such as spermidine, agmatine and putrescine at low affinity, but relatively high turnover (PubMed:21128598). Involved in the hepatic uptake of vitamin B1/thiamine, hence regulating hepatic lipid and energy metabolism (PubMed:24961373). Mediates the bidirectional transport of acetylcholine (ACh) at the apical membrane of ciliated cell in airway epithelium, thereby playing a role in luminal release of ACh from bronchial epithelium (PubMed:15817714). Transports dopaminergic neuromodulators cyclo(his-pro) and salsolinol with lower efficency (PubMed:17460754). Also capable of transporting non-amine endogenous compounds such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and prostaglandin F2-alpha (PGF2-alpha) (PubMed:11907186). May contribute to the transport of cationic compounds in testes across the blood-testis-barrier (Probable).

Recognizes small molecular motifs named pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMPs) expressed by pathogens and microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) usually expressed by resident microbiota (PubMed:29934223). Upon ligand binding such as bacterial flagellins, recruits intracellular adapter proteins MYD88 and TRIF leading to NF-kappa-B activation, cytokine secretion and induction of the inflammatory response (PubMed:11489966, PubMed:20855887). Plays thereby an important role in the relationship between the intestinal epithelium and enteric microbes and contributes to the gut microbiota composition throughout life (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9JLF7, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11323673, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11489966, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18490781, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20855887, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29934223}.

POLQ	DNA polymerase theta (DNA polymerase eta) [Includes: Helicase POLQ (EC 3.6.4.12); DNA polymerase POLQ (EC 2.7.7.7) (RNA-directed DNA polymerase POLQ) (EC 2.7.7.49)]	5'-deoxyribose-5-phosphate lyase activity [GO:0051575]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; ATP hydrolysis activity [GO:0016887]; chromatin binding [GO:0003682]; damaged DNA binding [GO:0003684]; DNA helicase activity [GO:0003678]; DNA-directed DNA polymerase activity [GO:0003887]; endonuclease activity [GO:0004519]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; magnesium ion binding [GO:0000287]; RNA-directed DNA polymerase activity [GO:0003964]; single-stranded DNA helicase activity [GO:0017116]	FUNCTION: Low-fidelity DNA polymerase with a helicase activity that promotes microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ), an alternative non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) machinery required to repair double-strand breaks in DNA during mitosis (PubMed:14576298, PubMed:18503084, PubMed:24648516, PubMed:25642963, PubMed:25643323, PubMed:25775267, PubMed:26636256, PubMed:27311885, PubMed:27591252, PubMed:30655289, PubMed:31562312, PubMed:32873648, PubMed:34140467, PubMed:34179826, PubMed:36455556, PubMed:37440612, PubMed:37674080). MMEJ is an error-prone repair pathway that produces deletions of sequences from the strand being repaired and promotes genomic rearrangements, such as telomere fusions, some of them leading to cellular transformation (PubMed:25642963, PubMed:25643323, PubMed:25775267, PubMed:27311885, PubMed:27591252, PubMed:31562312, PubMed:32873648). MMEJ is required during mitosis to repair persistent double-strand breaks that originate in S-phase (PubMed:37440612, PubMed:37674080). Although error-prone, MMEJ protects against chromosomal instability and tumorigenesis (By similarity). The polymerase acts by binding directly the 2 ends of resected double-strand breaks, allowing microhomologous sequences in the overhangs to form base pairs (PubMed:25643323, PubMed:25775267, PubMed:27311885, PubMed:27591252). It then extends each strand from the base-paired region using the opposing overhang as a template (PubMed:25643323, PubMed:25775267, PubMed:27311885, PubMed:27591252). Requires partially resected DNA containing 2 to 6 base pairs of microhomology to perform MMEJ (PubMed:25643323, PubMed:25775267, PubMed:27311885, PubMed:27591252). The polymerase lacks proofreading activity and is highly promiscuous: unlike most polymerases, promotes extension of ssDNA and partial ssDNA (pssDNA) substrates (PubMed:18503084, PubMed:21050863, PubMed:22135286). When the ends of a break do not contain terminal microhomology must identify embedded complementary sequences through a scanning step (PubMed:32234782). Also acts as a DNA helicase, promoting dissociation of the replication protein A complex (RPA/RP-A), composed of RPA1, RPA2 and RPA3, from resected double-strand breaks to allow their annealing and subsequent joining by MMEJ (PubMed:36455556). Removal of RPA/RP-A complex proteins prevents RAD51 accumulation at resected ends, thereby inhibiting homology-recombination repair (HR) pathway (PubMed:25642963, PubMed:28695890). Also shows RNA-directed DNA polymerase activity to mediate DNA repair in vitro; however this activity needs additional evidence in vivo (PubMed:34117057). May also have lyase activity (PubMed:19188258). Involved in somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes, a process that requires the activity of DNA polymerases to ultimately introduce mutations at both A/T and C/G base pairs (By similarity). POLQ-mediated end joining activity is involved in random integration of exogenous DNA hampers (PubMed:28695890). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8CGS6, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14576298, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18503084, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19188258, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21050863, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22135286, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24648516, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25642963, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25643323, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25775267, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26636256, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27311885, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27591252, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28695890, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30655289, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31562312, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32234782, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32873648, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34117057, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34140467, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34179826, ECO:0000269|PubMed:36455556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:37440612, ECO:0000269|PubMed:37674080}.

Required for siRNA production by DICER1 and for subsequent siRNA-mediated post-transcriptional gene silencing. Does not seem to be required for processing of pre-miRNA to miRNA by DICER1. Promotes UBC9-p53/TP53 association and sumoylation and phosphorylation of p53/TP53 at 'Lys-386' at 'Ser-392' respectively and enhances its activity in a EIF2AK2/PKR-dependent manner (By similarity). {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10336432, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11238927, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16424907, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16982605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17452327, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9687506}.

It cooperates with PNPLA2/ATGL in neuronal TAG catabolism and hydrolyzes sn-1,3 DAG downstream of PNPLA2/ATGL (By similarity). In vitro, it also acts as a phospholipase that hydrolyzes preferentially phosphatidic acids, including 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine.

OAS1	2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthase 1 ((2-5')oligo(A) synthase 1) (2-5A synthase 1) (EC 2.7.7.84) (E18/E16) (p46/p42 OAS)	2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase activity [GO:0001730]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; double-stranded RNA binding [GO:0003725]; metal ion binding [GO:0046872]	FUNCTION: Interferon-induced, dsRNA-activated antiviral enzyme which plays a critical role in cellular innate antiviral response (PubMed:34581622). In addition, it may also play a role in other cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell growth, differentiation and gene regulation. Synthesizes higher oligomers of 2'-5'-oligoadenylates (2-5A) from ATP which then bind to the inactive monomeric form of ribonuclease L (RNase L) leading to its dimerization and subsequent activation. Activation of RNase L leads to degradation of cellular as well as viral RNA, resulting in the inhibition of protein synthesis, thus terminating viral replication (PubMed:34145065, PubMed:34581622). Can mediate the antiviral effect via the classical RNase L-dependent pathway or an alternative antiviral pathway independent of RNase L. The secreted form displays antiviral effect against vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and stimulates the alternative antiviral pathway independent of RNase L. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12799444, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18931074, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19923450, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23319625, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34145065, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34581622}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform p46]: When prenylated at C-terminal, acts as a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensor specifically targeted to membranous replicative organelles in SARS coronavirus-2/SARS-CoV-2 infected cells where it binds to dsRNA structures in the SARS-CoV-2 5'-UTR and initiates a potent block to SARS-CoV-2 replication. Recognizes short stretches of dsRNA and activates RNase L. The binding is remarkably specific, with two conserved stem loops in the SARS-CoV-2 5'- untranslated region (UTR) constituting the principal viral target (PubMed:34581622). The same mechanism is necessary to initiate a block to cardiovirus EMCV (PubMed:34581622). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:34581622}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform p42]: Not prenylated at C-terminal, is diffusely localized and unable to initiate a detectable block to SARS-CoV-2 replication. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:34581622}.

They are considered to be major precursors of the protective proteinaceous structure on tooth surfaces (enamel pellicle). Hsts can be divided into two major groups according to their biological functions: antimicrobial Hsts (e.g. Hst 5/HTN3) and cell-activating Hsts (e.g. Hst 1/HTN1, Hst 2/HTN1 and Hst 3/HTN3) (PubMed:32225006). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:32225006, ECO:0000269|PubMed:3286634}.; FUNCTION: [Histatin-3]: Histatin 3 (Hst 3) is mostly involved in cell migration and wound healing in the oral cavity (PubMed:18650243). Also stimulates cell proliferation after binding to heat shock protein HSC70, which enhances HSC70-CDKN1B complex formation and subsequent ubiquitination during G1/S transition (PubMed:26775844). Also displays antifungal activity against pathogenic yeast Candida albicans, however with less effectiveness than Hst 5 (PubMed:11083804, PubMed:3286634). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11083804, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18650243, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26775844, ECO:0000269|PubMed:3286634}.; FUNCTION: [His3-(20-43)-peptide]: Histatin 5 (Hst 5), a fragment of Hst 3, is the major histatin exhibiting antifungal and antibacterial activities (PubMed:10066791, PubMed:11083804, PubMed:11179305, PubMed:11717389, PubMed:12939362, PubMed:15485849, PubMed:2372245, PubMed:8945538). It is effective against pathogenic yeast C. albicans, C. neoformans, C. glabrata and S. cerevisiae as well as ESKAPE bacterial pathogens (PubMed:18974864, PubMed:23613860, PubMed:2372245, PubMed:28261570, PubMed:8945538). Secreted Hst 5 mediates a multi-step intracellular mechanism of action against the pathogen. Depending on peptide concentration and pathogen, uptake across the membrane can occur through transporters, direct interaction with plasma membrane and/or receptor-mediated endocytosis (PubMed:18974864, PubMed:20487276, PubMed:28261570). Binds C. albicans cell wall proteins SSA1 and SSA2 and glycans in an energy-independent manner, then is taken up by the cells through fungal polyamine transporters DUR3 and DUR31 in an energy-dependent manner (PubMed:12761219, PubMed:20487276, PubMed:22033918, PubMed:23613860). Internalized Hst5 is then targeted to the energized mitochondrion to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and subsequent release of intracellular non-lytic ATP which ultimately leads to fungal cell death (PubMed:10066791, PubMed:11083804, PubMed:11717389). In addition, inhibits C. albicans TRK1 potassium-transporter which causes exudation of intracellular K(+), generating an osmotic imbalance leading to delayed membrane lysis and cell death (PubMed:15485849). Also acts as a potent inhibitor of bacterial proteases such as Lys-gingipain and Arg-gingipain (rgpB) from P. gingivalis as well as human metalloproteases MMP2 and MMP9 (PubMed:11179305). The binding of metals such as zinc, copper or nickel with Hst 5 results in the protection of the enamel and antimicrobial activities such as the inhibition of microbial growth by decreasing the metal concentration, the formation of ROS commonly associated with redox-active metals, the induction of membrane disruption mediated by zinc binding (PubMed:19846304, PubMed:28261570, PubMed:28763199, PubMed:32751915). Also involved in coating oral surfaces in the form of a salivary film which reduces colonization by C. albicans on epithelial cell surfaces (PubMed:26379655). Secreted Hst 5 can also internalize mammalian epithelial cells and target the mitochondria although it does not exert cytotoxic effects in these cells (PubMed:32225006).

The receptor systems for IL6, LIF, OSM, CNTF, IL11, CTF1 and BSF3 can utilize IL6ST for initiating signal transmission. Binding of IL6 to IL6R induces IL6ST homodimerization and formation of a high-affinity receptor complex, which activates the intracellular JAK-MAPK and JAK-STAT3 signaling pathways (PubMed:19915009, PubMed:2261637, PubMed:23294003). That causes phosphorylation of IL6ST tyrosine residues which in turn activates STAT3 (PubMed:19915009, PubMed:23294003, PubMed:25731159). In parallel, the IL6 signaling pathway induces the expression of two cytokine receptor signaling inhibitors, SOCS1 and SOCS3, which inhibit JAK and terminate the activity of the IL6 signaling pathway as a negative feedback loop (By similarity). Also activates the yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) and NOTCH pathways to control inflammation-induced epithelial regeneration, independently of STAT3 (By similarity).

Catalytic subunit of the MLL1/MLL complex, a multiprotein complex that mediates both methylation of 'Lys-4' of histone H3 (H3K4me) complex and acetylation of 'Lys-16' of histone H4 (H4K16ac) (PubMed:12453419, PubMed:15960975, PubMed:19187761, PubMed:19556245, PubMed:20677832, PubMed:21220120, PubMed:24235145, PubMed:26886794). Catalyzes methyl group transfer from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the epsilon-amino group of 'Lys-4' of histone H3 (H3K4) via a non-processive mechanism. Part of chromatin remodeling machinery predominantly forms H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 methylation marks at active chromatin sites where transcription and DNA repair take place (PubMed:12453419, PubMed:15960975, PubMed:19187761, PubMed:19556245, PubMed:20677832, PubMed:21220120, PubMed:25561738, PubMed:26886794). Has weak methyltransferase activity by itself, and requires other component of the MLL1/MLL complex to obtain full methyltransferase activity (PubMed:19187761, PubMed:26886794). Has no activity toward histone H3 phosphorylated on 'Thr-3', less activity toward H3 dimethylated on 'Arg-8' or 'Lys-9', while it has higher activity toward H3 acetylated on 'Lys-9' (PubMed:19187761).

In complex with TAP1 mediates unidirectional translocation of peptide antigens from cytosol to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for loading onto MHC class I (MHCI) molecules (PubMed:25377891, PubMed:25656091). Uses the chemical energy of ATP to export peptides against the concentration gradient (PubMed:25377891). During the transport cycle alternates between 'inward-facing' state with peptide binding site facing the cytosol to 'outward-facing' state with peptide binding site facing the ER lumen. Peptide antigen binding to ATP-loaded TAP1-TAP2 induces a switch to hydrolysis-competent 'outward-facing' conformation ready for peptide loading onto nascent MHCI molecules. Subsequently ATP hydrolysis resets the transporter to the 'inward facing' state for a new cycle (PubMed:11274390, PubMed:25377891, PubMed:25656091). Typically transports intracellular peptide antigens of 8 to 13 amino acids that arise from cytosolic proteolysis via IFNG-induced immunoproteasome. Binds peptides with free N- and C-termini, the first three and the C-terminal residues being critical. Preferentially selects peptides having a highly hydrophobic residue at position 3 and hydrophobic or charged residues at the C-terminal anchor. Proline at position 2 has the most destabilizing effect (PubMed:11274390, PubMed:7500034, PubMed:9256420).

Initiator protease that induces extrinsic apoptosis by mediating cleavage and activation of effector caspases responsible for FAS/CD95-mediated and TNFRSF1A-induced cell death (PubMed:23516580, PubMed:35338844, PubMed:35446120, PubMed:8681376, PubMed:8681377, PubMed:8962078, PubMed:9006941, PubMed:9184224). Cleaves and activates effector caspases CASP3, CASP4, CASP6, CASP7, CASP9 and CASP10 (PubMed:16916640, PubMed:8962078, PubMed:9006941). Binding to the adapter molecule FADD recruits it to either receptor FAS/TNFRSF6 or TNFRSF1A (PubMed:8681376, PubMed:8681377). The resulting aggregate called the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) performs CASP8 proteolytic activation (PubMed:9184224). The active dimeric enzyme is then liberated from the DISC and free to activate downstream apoptotic proteases (PubMed:9184224). Proteolytic fragments of the N-terminal propeptide (termed CAP3, CAP5 and CAP6) are likely retained in the DISC (PubMed:9184224). In addition to extrinsic apoptosis, also acts as a negative regulator of necroptosis: acts by cleaving RIPK1 at 'Asp-324', which is crucial to inhibit RIPK1 kinase activity, limiting TNF-induced apoptosis, necroptosis and inflammatory response (PubMed:31827280, PubMed:31827281). Also able to initiate pyroptosis by mediating cleavage and activation of gasdermin-C and -D (GSDMC and GSDMD, respectively): gasdermin cleavage promotes release of the N-terminal moiety that binds to membranes and forms pores, triggering pyroptosis (PubMed:32929201, PubMed:34012073). Initiates pyroptosis following inactivation of MAP3K7/TAK1 (By similarity).

HLA-DRB5	HLA class II histocompatibility antigen, DR beta 5 chain (DR beta-5) (DR2-beta-2) (Dw2) (MHC class II antigen DRB5)	MHC class II protein complex binding [GO:0023026]; peptide antigen binding [GO:0042605]	FUNCTION: Binds peptides derived from antigens that access the endocytic route of antigen presenting cells (APC) and presents them on the cell surface for recognition by the CD4 T-cells. The peptide binding cleft accommodates peptides of 10-30 residues. The peptides presented by MHC class II molecules are generated mostly by degradation of proteins that access the endocytic route, where they are processed by lysosomal proteases and other hydrolases. Exogenous antigens that have been endocytosed by the APC are thus readily available for presentation via MHC II molecules, and for this reason this antigen presentation pathway is usually referred to as exogenous. As membrane proteins on their way to degradation in lysosomes as part of their normal turn-over are also contained in the endosomal/lysosomal compartments, exogenous antigens must compete with those derived from endogenous components. Autophagy is also a source of endogenous peptides, autophagosomes constitutively fuse with MHC class II loading compartments. In addition to APCs, other cells of the gastrointestinal tract, such as epithelial cells, express MHC class II molecules and CD74 and act as APCs, which is an unusual trait of the GI tract. To produce a MHC class II molecule that presents an antigen, three MHC class II molecules (heterodimers of an alpha and a beta chain) associate with a CD74 trimer in the ER to form a heterononamer. Soon after the entry of this complex into the endosomal/lysosomal system where antigen processing occurs, CD74 undergoes a sequential degradation by various proteases, including CTSS and CTSL, leaving a small fragment termed CLIP (class-II-associated invariant chain peptide). The removal of CLIP is facilitated by HLA-DM via direct binding to the alpha-beta-CLIP complex so that CLIP is released. HLA-DM stabilizes MHC class II molecules until primary high affinity antigenic peptides are bound. The MHC II molecule bound to a peptide is then transported to the cell membrane surface.

Specifically activated by muramyl dipeptide (MDP), a fragment of bacterial peptidoglycan found in every bacterial peptidoglycan type (PubMed:12514169, PubMed:12527755, PubMed:12626759, PubMed:12871942, PubMed:15044951, PubMed:15198989, PubMed:15998797, PubMed:22857257, PubMed:23322906, PubMed:27748583, PubMed:36002575). NOD2 specifically recognizes and binds 6-O-phospho-MDP, the phosphorylated form of MDP, which is generated by NAGK (PubMed:36002575). 6-O-phospho-MDP-binding triggers oligomerization that facilitates the binding and subsequent activation of the proximal adapter receptor-interacting RIPK2 (PubMed:11087742, PubMed:17355968, PubMed:21887730, PubMed:23806334, PubMed:28436939). Following recruitment, RIPK2 undergoes 'Met-1'- (linear) and 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination by E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases XIAP, BIRC2, BIRC3 and the LUBAC complex, becoming a scaffolding protein for downstream effectors, triggering activation of the NF-kappa-B and MAP kinases signaling (PubMed:11087742, PubMed:12514169, PubMed:12626759, PubMed:15198989, PubMed:21887730, PubMed:23322906, PubMed:23806334, PubMed:28436939). This in turn leads to the transcriptional activation of hundreds of genes involved in immune response (PubMed:15198989). Its ability to detect bacterial MDP plays a central role in maintaining the equilibrium between intestinal microbiota and host immune responses to control inflammation (By similarity). An imbalance in this relationship results in dysbiosis, whereby pathogenic bacteria prevail on commensals, causing damage in the intestinal epithelial barrier as well as allowing bacterial invasion and inflammation (By similarity). Acts as a regulator of appetite by sensing MDP in a subset of brain neurons: microbiota-derived MDP reach the brain, where they bind and activate NOD2 in inhibitory hypothalamic neurons, decreasing neuronal activity, thereby regulating satiety and body temperature (By similarity). NOD2-dependent MDP-sensing of bacterial cell walls in the intestinal epithelial compartment contributes to sustained postnatal growth upon undernutrition (By similarity). Also plays a role in antiviral response by acting as a sensor of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) from viruses: upon ssRNA-binding, interacts with MAVS, leading to activation of interferon regulatory factor-3/IRF3 and expression of type I interferon (PubMed:19701189). Also acts as a regulator of autophagy in dendritic cells via its interaction with ATG16L1, possibly by recruiting ATG16L1 at the site of bacterial entry (PubMed:20637199). NOD2 activation in the small intestine crypt also contributes to intestinal stem cells survival and function: acts by promoting mitophagy via its association with ATG16L1 (By similarity). In addition to its main role in innate immunity, also regulates the adaptive immune system by acting as regulator of helper T-cell and regulatory T-cells (Tregs) (By similarity). Besides recognizing pathogens, also involved in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response: acts by sensing and binding to the cytosolic metabolite sphingosine-1-phosphate generated in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress, initiating an inflammation process that leads to activation of the NF-kappa-B and MAP kinases signaling (PubMed:27007849, PubMed:33942347). May also be involved in NLRP1 activation following activation by MDP, leading to CASP1 activation and IL1B release in macrophages (PubMed:18511561). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8K3Z0, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11087742, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12514169, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12527755, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12626759, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12871942, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15044951, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15198989, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15998797, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17355968, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18511561, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19701189, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20637199, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21887730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22857257, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23322906, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23806334, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27007849, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27283905, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27748583, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28436939, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31649195, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33942347, ECO:0000269|PubMed:36002575}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform 2]: Acts as a pattern recognition receptor (PRR); able to activate NF-kappa-B. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11087742}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform 3]: Can activate NF-kappa-B in a muramyl dipeptide (MDP)-independent manner. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20698950}.

ERVW-1	Syncytin-1 (Endogenous retrovirus group W member 1) (Env-W) (Envelope polyprotein gPr73) (Enverin) (HERV-7q Envelope protein) (HERV-W envelope protein) (HERV-W_7q21.2 provirus ancestral Env polyprotein) (Syncytin) [Cleaved into: Surface protein (SU) (gp50); Transmembrane protein (TM) (gp24)]	NA	FUNCTION: This endogenous retroviral envelope protein has retained its original fusogenic properties and participates in trophoblast fusion and the formation of a syncytium during placenta morphogenesis. May induce fusion through binding of SLC1A4 and SLC1A5 (PubMed:10708449, PubMed:12050356, PubMed:23492904). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10708449, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12050356, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23492904}.; FUNCTION: Endogenous envelope proteins may have kept, lost or modified their original function during evolution.

MMACHC	Cyanocobalamin reductase / alkylcobalamin dealkylase (Alkylcobalamin:glutathione S-alkyltransferase) (EC 2.5.1.151) (CblC) (Cyanocobalamin reductase (cyanide-eliminating)) (EC 1.16.1.6) (Methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria type C protein) (MMACHC)	cobalamin binding [GO:0031419]; cyanocobalamin reductase (cyanide-eliminating) (NADP+) activity [GO:0033787]; demethylase activity [GO:0032451]; FAD binding [GO:0071949]; glutathione binding [GO:0043295]; oxidoreductase activity [GO:0016491]; protein homodimerization activity [GO:0042803]; transferase activity, transferring alkyl or aryl (other than methyl) groups [GO:0016765]	FUNCTION: Cobalamin (vitamin B12) cytosolic chaperone that catalyzes the reductive decyanation of cyanocob(III)alamin (cyanocobalamin, CNCbl) to yield cob(II)alamin and cyanide, using FAD or FMN as cofactors and NADPH as cosubstrate (PubMed:18779575, PubMed:19700356, PubMed:21697092, PubMed:25809485). Cyanocobalamin constitutes the inactive form of vitamin B12 introduced from the diet, and is converted into the active cofactors methylcobalamin (MeCbl) involved in methionine biosynthesis, and 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) involved in the TCA cycle (PubMed:19801555). Forms a complex with the lysosomal transporter ABCD4 and its chaperone LMBRD1, to transport cobalamin across the lysosomal membrane into the cytosol (PubMed:25535791). The processing of cobalamin in the cytosol occurs in a multiprotein complex composed of at least MMACHC, MMADHC, MTRR (methionine synthase reductase) and MTR (methionine synthase) which may contribute to shuttle safely and efficiently cobalamin towards MTR in order to produce methionine (PubMed:21071249, PubMed:27771510). Also acts as a glutathione transferase by catalyzing the dealkylation of the alkylcob(III)alamins MeCbl and AdoCbl, using the thiolate of glutathione for nucleophilic displacement to generate cob(I)alamin and the corresponding glutathione thioether (PubMed:19801555, PubMed:21697092, PubMed:22642810, PubMed:25809485). The conversion of incoming MeCbl or AdoCbl into a common intermediate cob(I)alamin is necessary to meet the cellular needs for both cofactors (PubMed:19801555). Cysteine and homocysteine cannot substitute for glutathione in this reaction (PubMed:19801555). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18779575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19700356, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19801555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21071249, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21697092, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22642810, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25809485, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27771510, ECO:0000303|PubMed:19801555, ECO:0000303|PubMed:25535791}.
