**Evidence Interpretation Summary**

The gene/protein MMACHC (Cyanocobalamin reductase/alkylcobalamin dealkylase) plays a critical role in cobalamin metabolism and is involved in both methionine biosynthesis and cofactor production for the TCA cycle. As a cytosolic chaperone, MMACHC facilitates the transport of cyanocobalamin (CNCbl), an inactive form of vitamin B12, into the cytosol, where it undergoes reductive decyanation to produce cobalamin precursors such as methylcobalamin (MeCbl) and 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl). These cofactors are essential for key biochemical pathways in cell metabolism.

The functional relevance of MMACHC is underscored by its role in cobalamin-dependent methionine biosynthesis, where it works with other proteins such as MTRR and MTR to shuttle cobalamin toward the methionine synthase enzymes. Additionally, MMACHC functions as a glutathione transferase, enabling the dealkylation of MeCbl and AdoCbl to generate their active cofactors (cob(I)alumin). Disruption of this process, whether through gene mutation or other abnormalities, can lead to significant clinical consequences, particularly in vitamin B12 deficiency disorders.

The pathogenic variant identified in this case study is classified as pathogenic based on the complex scoring functions employed by GuRu. The high score assigned to the variant (e.g., ECO:0000269|PubMed:18779575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19700356, etc.) reflects its strong association with abnormal cobalamin processing and disrupted methionine metabolism. This classification is supported by evidence of impaired protein function in the multiprotein complex responsible for cobalamin transport and conversion within the cytosol.

The evidence supporting this interpretation is robust, as the variant's impact on cobalamin-dependent pathways aligns with known molecular mechanisms affecting both methionine biosynthesis and TCA cycle cofactor production. This classification provides a strong foundation for further genetic studies aimed at elucidating the pathological implications of this mutation in clinical contexts.
